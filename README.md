# Zippatore

I wanted to create a simple zipping utility to practice my skills and learn new ones. Zippatore is the result of this journey, and I’ve poured my heart into this repo. I’m excited to keep optimizing and adding new features!

**My todo list so far**
- Simplify the codebase
- Add the possibility to zip more than one file
- Add the possibility to zip file with UTF-8 char
- Fix a problem that occur if the file contains only 1 type of char
- Find a better way to serialize the binary-tree
